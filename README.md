# Hyper Unicorn Gamejam 2022 (Part 1)
This is the repository for our game submission for the Hyper Unicorn Gamejam 2022 (Part 1).

## JamOS
JamOS is a game where you're in a fake operating system and you're trying to get into the 'homework' folder. It was supposed to have all sorts of silly puzzles but since we had some personal issues, that fell apart. Right now you can mess around, look at some memes and do the only existing puzzle for the grand prize!

## Installation
On the right you can click on releases and download the zipped game for your real operating system.
All you have to do is unzip and run the executable file! **Do keep in mind that linux and macOS builds are untested!**
